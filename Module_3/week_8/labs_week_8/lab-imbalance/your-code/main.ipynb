    "Like we disussed in class, when we have noisy data, if we are not careful, we can end up fitting our model to the noise in the data and not the 'signal' (the factors that actually determine the outcome). This is called overfitting, and results in good results in training and in bad results when the model is applied to real data. Similarly, we could have a model that is too simplistic to accurately model the signal. This produces a model that doesn't work well (ever)."
